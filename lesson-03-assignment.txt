# Assignment 3

1. What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.
We need to add two new tables named topics and lesson_topics and update an existing table lessons.
    topics – Stores topics covered in lessons.
    lesson_topics – A join table that establishes a many-to-many relationship between lessons and topics.
    lessons (existing) – Updated to ensure proper relationships with courses and topics.

2. What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on? 
    A topic can be associated with many lessons through lesson_topics.
    LessonTopic establishes the many-to-many relationship between Lesson and Topic.
    A lesson belongs to one course.
    A lesson can be associated with many topics through lesson_topics.

3. What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored? Write out each table's name and column names with data types.
Table: topics
--------------------------------
id          | integer (primary key)
title       | string (unique)
created_at  | datetime
updated_at  | datetime

Table: lesson_topics 
--------------------------------
id          | integer (primary key)
lesson_id   | integer (foreign key, references lessons)
topic_id    | integer (foreign key, references topics)
created_at  | datetime
updated_at  | datetime

Table: lessons
--------------------------------
id                  | integer (primary key)
course_id           | integer (foreign key, references courses)
title               | string (unique, not null)
assignment_due_date | datetime
created_at          | datetime
updated_at          | datetime

# Database Relationships Summary
    A Lesson belongs to a Course.
    A Lesson has many Topics through LessonTopics.
    A Topic has many Lessons through LessonTopics.
    LessonTopic belongs to both Lesson and Topic.

# Generate schema table and migration

bin/rails generate migration create_topics

class CreateTopics < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :topics do |t|
      t.string :title, null: false
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

bin/rails generate model Topic

bin/rails generate migration create_lesson_topics

class CreateLessonTopics < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :lesson_topics do |t|
      t.references :lesson, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :topic, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

bin/rails generate model lesson_topic

Models: 

class Lesson < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :course
  has_many :lesson_topics
  has_many :topics, through: :lesson_topics
end

class Topic < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :lesson_topics
    has_many :lessons, through: :lesson_topics
  end

class LessonTopic < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :lesson
    belongs_to :topic
  end

# Test in Rails Console:

bin/rails console

sql = Topic.create(title: "SQL")
css = Topic.create(title: "CSS")

lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Introduction to Databases", course_id: 1)

lesson.topics << sql
lesson.topics << css

lesson.topics
